This folder contains training and visualization code related to Reinforcement Learning. Checkpoints are also provided. Gif's illustrate the actions of the trained agents. The notebooks should work with any of the environment from [Gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) with only minor modifications.
